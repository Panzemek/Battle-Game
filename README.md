# Battle-Game
This game lets you select from four fighter options to battle the others.  It is primarily an art showcase.


## Page Components
Bootstrap - Used for the html formatting.  Styling is minimal and functional.

Javascript/jquery - The majority of the work in this website is in these two components.  They are used to define the characteristics of the combatants and track all the values as the game proceeds.  They also are used to display the information in the game as it changes.


## Challenges
I suspect there is a way to react to the combatants conditionally more efficiently than I have, with many somewhat repetitive if statements.  It is functional, but likely overly verbose to track the hero and enemy selections.
